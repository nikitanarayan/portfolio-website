Blocks: [{"content":{"title":"","video":[],"length":"","text":"The opening act to be set in the market scene, outside of the stores with their own smaller acts, is the longest one. It starts at about 10 AM, when the first actors, men, all playing storekeepers gradually enter the scene with women following after. About an hour before noon, the set is full, with all actors, occupying their respective positions. Smaller acts include men and women crossing streets, with women walking past stores in groups. The actors are to act from memory and the nostalgia of a previous act. The vital, perhaps the most challenging part is to co-ordinate the whole scene while the traffic moves as usual along the jagged lanes. The actors, the stores, the space, the traffic, the honking, all merge together, composing, enacting and reenacting. Each corner of the market concentrates on recreating different moments through different acts."},"id":"f151c836-a9ed-4392-b147-6b1890d3a036","isHidden":false,"type":"item"},{"content":{"title":"Bangle Store","video":["bangle_store.mp4"],"length":"02:50","text":"Dear Common Good, I\u2019m a designer, currently working on a short film. I have for the longest time followed your chief executive, Mr. Siddharth Gupta and his irrefutable take on naming brands. I particularly identify with his naming of the Ganga pressure cooker; my friend\u2019s mother had the same name and we were close friends. My friend, when she got married, also received an entire Ganga cooking range as a wedding gift. I believe, the groom\u2019s family were quite particular about what gifts they wanted. And me, I\u2019ve never taken a meal without bread made from the wheat flour, Annapurna. As best as I can remember, I did not have a friend by this name, though, my grandmother, a devout lady, prayed without end to the goddess, Annapurna. Mr. Gupta is a revered Ad Man, and I\u2019d love to have him sit for a talk. This interview, I strongly believe, will put the rest of the plot into perspective."},"id":"605f1a30-21f5-4a8f-b0a1-c90737972cbd","isHidden":false,"type":"item"},{"content":{"title":"Grahasti Store","video":["grahasti_store.mp4"],"length":"06:30","text":"The question is, why does the muezzin suddenly follow up his recital with a declaration of his love for India? Or was it a plea? A plea far too big, a distance too remote for this neighborhood minaret to broadcast. And so, should I let part of this footage stay even though I could not logically connect it to the others ? Or the movie, is it really about identities and the weight of their struggle. And I had been looking for a face, a face most depicting of this fear. But for now, I will have to organize and find within this sound those precise points of nostalgia, power and fear."},"id":"d6426405-8e1a-4225-9f5d-e15de38fd3e2","isHidden":false,"type":"item"},{"content":{"title":"The Ustensil Store","video":["the_ustensil_store.mp4"],"length":"02:19","text":"And what of the bride, who reaches her marital home with utensils filled to their brim with grains, evidence of having received good care or upbringing (likely one of those)? Do we see these utensils in the frame? Should we see them? Close-ups, stills or do we see them as they are emptied by those in this home? Utensils filled with grain, gradually emptied. Must we see this to understand the story?"},"id":"2900ee0b-5d96-4d9c-b9cc-de52e9df4415","isHidden":false,"type":"item"},{"content":{"title":"The Street","video":["the_street.mp4"],"length":"02:20","text":"If nostalgia was the story, would it tell itself? But what if in its rare retelling, those images, objects, sounds and dialogues whose summoning this involves, tells you something else, a story in its multiple digressions, where objects that initially appear like gift shop souvenirs of past, mass manufactured shapes of collective memories, but instead turn out to be just flotsam. And in its salvage, you\u2019re partially pressed between what you felt then and what you know now."},"id":"5940b249-f4c1-4077-ba51-36811a76abc8","isHidden":false,"type":"item"}]
