The statement was part of a series of statements by leaders from the political right the Muslim minority.\n\nA look at the data shows that Singh\u2019s statement is not just inflammatory but indeed inconsistent with the facts. India\u2019s Muslim community will indeed expand faster than its Hindu population, rising from 14.4% in 2010 to 18.4% in 2050. But, even with this increase, Hindus will make up more than three-in-four Indians in 2050. In fact, the number of Hindus in India will still be larger than the five largest Muslim populations in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim countries combined."},"id":"4ff99b34-cdc9-444d-9c1f-440d4bdba7bc","isHidden":false,"type":"item"},{"content":{"quote":"\u201cHindus give birth only to one or two children; Muslims worried about how to take over the nation by increasing their population\u201d","image":["infographics_image_2.jpg"],"source":"Pew Research, April 2015, and National Family Health Survey, 2015-16.","text":"Continuing with the Hindu vs. Muslim rhetoric, Banwari Lal Singhal, a BJP legislator from Rajasthan said, \u201cwhile Hindus have one or two children and focus on educating them, Muslims worried about (sic) how to take over the nation by increasing their population.\u201d While in reality, fertility rates in India are more closely related to education levels and the socio-economic development within a state, than to religious beliefs.\n\nThis chart compares Total Fertility Rates of Hindus and Muslims against Human Development Index in seven Indian states."},"id":"4148009a-2e6f-498b-9d0b-5d95e1311fd6","isHidden":false,"type":"item"},{"content":{"quote":"\u201cThe pattern of Hate Crimes committed against Muslims with seeming impunity is deeply worrying.\u201d","image":["infographics_image_3.jpg"],"source":"Hate Crime Watch by Factchecker.in, 2018","text":"Several human rights organizations including Amnesty International have repeatedly pointed out a seeming increase in the number of hate crimes predominantly against the minorities in recent years.
