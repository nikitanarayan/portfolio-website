Text: [{"content":{"title":"Introduction","text":"India, to me, has always been a place where language is visual and where visuals are languages of their own. The landscape overweight with people, vehicles, objects, posters, ads, festivals and the air always thick with a resulting soundscape. But when you move around and carry less and less of what once meant familiar, when you cross many borders but never fully enter one and realize that belonging is only a relative term, you find that your only familiar is the in-between, and your identity liminal. This liminal state and a subsequent ikea fatigue left me wanting to explore my once familiar, my once certain landscape I called home. A landscape where the recent arrival of ikea only meant that more chairs and tables, more bedrooms and more kitchens will look alike. Objects that once outlived their owners would likely lose to those whose easy disposability suggested modernity to the growing middle class. With these anxieties, I reached India to document these objects and their role in shaping an identity. \n\nI set out to document objects that had a sense of attachment and the idea of the kitchen and its objects where experiences around everyday life are invoked seemed like a possible anchor. And in exploring the many things and objects that occupy the space that is kitchen, I was eventually drawn to places where these objects would traverse before they landed in the kitchen.","glossary":[]},"id":"2f20272e-34f3-435d-a775-2816fb497e32","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"(glossary: 1 text: Hyderabad)","text":"For the objects to be deemed worthy of this archiving, they had to be dated. That was the only determining factor, somehow certain in my head but rife in all its vagueness.

The insecurities of not having a prior design education always ran deep and meant an endless colossal dissatisfaction with the results. Each day was dedicated to photographing one object. Others, corralled like convicts, waited for their turn.

Lanes got narrower in the interiors of the market, drivers and motorcyclists intensely honked at the pedestrians. The (glossary: 2 text: Bazar) was the oldest in the city and close to where I grew up. After a period of what appeared like apostasy, it almost felt like a make-up. \n\nThe lanes ran across and opened into each other like a labyrinth, leaving only slim gaps to walk. Those buried inside with only pedestrians, were quieter. The stores, selling kitchen utensils of all kinds were tightly packed, some too tiny to even register at first. All lanes led to the main square, which, too wild to leave any room for thought meant, once reached, you had to be prepared to go either way. I hold my camera close, hesitant to ask for permission and too anxious to explain why I was here. Some docile pictures of the owners and their stores later, I feel somewhat settled. I haul back a bag of objects home. A knife with an ornate blade encased in a wooden shell, a stacked steel tiffin box, a granite mortar and pestle, a brass nutcracker, a stack of (glossary: 3 text: *patravali*), all fitting into my nostalgic associations of the Indian kitchen.

The pictures, when looked repeatedly, either felt like an imaginary longing or those under some kind of an examination. Some photographed on the streets appeared as evidences of their existence. But nostalgia couldn\u2019t account for my uneasy, inconsistent feelings around the idea of kitchen with a realization that this pining may have been because of a certain distance I was able to establish between myself and a life in the kitchen. And therefore, concluding the whole process as nostalgic somehow felt like a self-indulgent mawkish exercise. \n\nAfter days of such ritualistic visits to the market and photographing, when the attention shifted to more missing objects, a sudden thought of the woman in the kitchen, the greatest of all perceived objects, swept in. I recall ads selling pressure cookers I had seen growing up. Ads that proclaimed, (glossary: 4 text: \u2018If you loved your wife, you wouldn\u2019t say no to Prestige!\u201d). Ads which advertised to men to buy certain pressure cookers for their wives, all revealing the decision maker and the eventual user who would dedicate her life to their care. The ad was indicative of a man\u2019s authority and an agency that the woman lacked. An agency that all human beings needed, desired and only objects devoid of.\n\nAnd the thought of some women in my life, who, in spending their life\u2019s entirety in the kitchen, made the nostalgia of the kitchen and its objects without the woman, now feel like a ploy, an infatuation. Should then all objects of beauty, as signifiers of a certain idea of womanhood and indicative of their presence on her body and therefore of her presence in the kitchen, also be considered as kitchen objects? The new list of objects I was compiling now felt like a litany of complaints. The next day, I photographed, some glass bangles, sindoor, some bindis and henna.","glossary":[{"number":4,"text":"\u2018Prestige Jo Biwi se - Pressure Cooker\u2019, Prestige Social, February 26, 2012, video, 1:03, (link: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CxLJd1ZaYas text: Link)."}]},"id":"a84ec2fd-6f5a-4e4a-84ed-ee5250510dc0","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"The Kitchen","text":"Notions of domesticity and feminism have long been investigated and questioned by female artists. Martha Rosler\u2019s performance piece \u2018Semiotics of the kitchen\u2019, where a woman, presumably a housewife, whose impassive demonstration of the kitchen tools slowly changes into a resentful show, expresses more about the drudgery of the kitchen than any documentary or words could. Once the comic portrayal wears off, one is confounded by the non-verbal, the gestures, the emotions that become primary modes of conveying the information. As the video progresses, one is left feeling that the perfunctory nature of the chores diminishes the difference between the human and the tool, the object and the objects. Both appear to have a proprietor, the provider, the guardian. The objects are tools, props, weapons, traps, commodities. The object is objectified, is a machine, is abused, is commodified. All acts of demonstration assume they have an audience, that they\u2019re being watched, and in that, this act of demonstrating the kitchen tools assumes the presence of a gaze. The demonstration feels like it addresses the gaze. The placid commentary resembling the imposition of a disciplined behavior and the utensil thuds, a once private agitation.\n\nChantal Akerman\u2019s movie *Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles* is an unerring portrayal of a ritualized life confined to duties and care. The movie, largely devoid of a plot that characterize general notions of popular cinema, is unapologetic with its extremely drawn out scenes of the protagonist\u2019s life buried in chores. The anger here is quiet. It is as if the chores here are being performed in their exact length and therefore almost feel frustrating to watch to them unfold, again, this time on the screen. The movie was a willful attempt at making the viewer recount and acknowledge instances where one received such care. The movie was not just a depiction of a performative life, but it was a performance on time, making the viewer not just aware but endure time. In its complete rejection of this notion of time and an unwillingness to treat the chores as mere pieces of information, the movie was a protest in itself. \n\nA movie database, IMDb, summarizes Akerman\u2019s other movie *Saut\u00e9 ma Ville* as \u2018A young girl shuts herself away in her apartment and goes about her business in a strange way, as she wastes the night in her apartment.\u2019 By \u2018her business in a strange way\u2019, they likely mean shopping for groceries, cooking, doing the dishes and swabbing the floor. One can\u2019t entirely be sure if \u2018she wastes the night in her apartment\u2019 as the movie ends with the woman self-immolating herself. In stripping the movie down to just details of domestic chores and by restricting the entire scene to the kitchen space, Akerman is indicating here of a life that is reduced to chores and confinement. But when these domestic duties wear off and fail to cast their spell any longer, death becomes the last act in the repertory that is kitchen, the last (in)significant act in the holy sanctuary of care. And when the kitchen, its objects become sole witnesses to a life of struggle and confinement, the lure of the kitchen as a suitable place for this final act of protest seems understandable. A protest with a mess whose \u2018cleaning up\u2019 is rendered unthinkable. \n\nWhile the description from a database may not be reflective of what entire groups of population think, perhaps the language is representative of how care is viewed in popular perception. This cursory description is indicative of an indifference towards domestic care, its labors and a confinement that it\u2019s fulfilling most often imposes. And to care often becomes a precondition to be a woman and it\u2019s carrying out only a committal to a gender. To question this, the understanding of agencies and ethics involved in care become central. Maria de la Bellacasa in *Matters of Care*, argues for this unaccounted labor and stresses for the need to speculate the many meanings of care in order to account and understand \u201cwho\/what is not counted or not assembled and why\u201d. Bellacasa argues that it is in these speculations can one begin to understand the lost autonomies and moral control that generally underpin care and specifically those associated with women.","glossary":[]},"id":"dd51de3b-c85d-4c58-a422-522d56c2ac68","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Begum Bazar II","text":"The walk from the cab drop off point to the main square of the market was about five minutes. I was here again, this time, to walk around without a purpose. After some inanimate pictures of the main street, this time I was at a utensil store right in the middle of the square. After a seemingly pleasant conversation about the store, the market, my attention, while still at the store, was drawn to the store right across the street. From a distance of what felt like a couple of feet, it appeared that the store was selling religious goods like incense sticks, idols of gods and goddesses, turmeric, vermillion and other related things used in Hindu religious rituals. I walk a little further and find some other stores, though few in number, they sold jewelry and bridal wear. \n\nA few photographs later, I walk to another store, which I was informed, was the one of the oldest utensil stores in the market. The store was called \u2018Grahasti\u2019. After the first rounds of permissions, introductions followed by some explanations about me documenting the market, I ask about the store. The store started in 1945, was divided amongst and run by three brothers, each specializing in a different kind of kitchen tool. I also notice a different store right beside Grahasti, called \u2018Sansar\u2019, which too sold kitchen objects.\n\nOn my return home, I look up for the meaning of the word \u2018Grahasti\u2019. Collins Dictionary translated \u2018Grahasti\u2019 as Noun Feminine:\n\n> \u2018Grahasti\u2019 = household SINGULAR NOUN\n> The household is your home, and everything connected with looking after it.\n> Usage: My husband gave me cash to manage the household., ...the household chores.\n\nOn the other hand, \u2018Sansar\u2019, a commonly used word, translates to world.\nBut, what kind of worlds did these stores announce? And whose worlds were they designing? And who lived in these worlds?","glossary":[]},"id":"a8934770-f4e8-4e5d-b18d-d191577b1687","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"The Home","text":"Once home, the thought of the market and the proximity of the utensil stores and religious supplies store comes back. At once, my attention is shifted to my home. I notice the layout, the kitchen right next to the prayer room. What felt like a frivolous detail of design all along, now felt full of disguise. Most Hindu homes follow \u2018Vaastu Shastra\u2019, a traditional architectural guide to a certain spatial arrangement in accordance the use of different spaces in relation to each other. I recount most homes I\u2019ve seen. Some had a similar layout. But some others didn\u2019t. Regardless of whether these design principles were unbending or not, the proximity reminded me of my own grandmother and a life that was consumed by the deity and duty. The proximity that meant she could quickly move from the prayer room to the kitchen and from being the devotee to the dutiful mother.","glossary":[]},"id":"b138cb45-475a-4a32-9607-7e2df84175fd","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Begum Bazar III","text":"I start my walk with a different lane this time. This lane, full of religious supply stores, is about a five-minute stretch from the periphery, where I start, to the end, which is the main market square. Like others, this lane too is dominated by stores of one kind, but the order is occasionally broken every now and then with a beauty supplies or a utensil store. Once at the square, I cross the street to the other side. Visibly, most stores seem to be run by men with only a negligible few who have women employed as sales help. More lanes appear, each opening and leading into another. One such busy lane was a lane called \u2018Nagari Market\u2019, *Nagari* translating to a small town. This town, crowded with stores selling bridal wear, bangles, handbags and beauty supplies, women bargaining, and boxes of new supplies constantly brought in and shipped out, streets littered with worn out packaging, was a town clearly dedicated to the business of beauty. Every now and then, a lane appears with a temple or a shrine tucked in. Walking a few steps further, to what almost felt like the end, I see stores selling toys. Deep into the market, I see plastic goods stores promising everything from a mop, and a bucket to diapers sold in bulk and retail. Walking back to the main square, I pass a pack of grocery stores. \n\nWatching women move from store to store meditatively, obsessively, as if their circumambulation symbolized and solidified their collective belief in something bigger than them, bigger than their part in this space, forced self-reflection. Mapping my own routes and movements to the scene reminded me of the women I\u2019ve known, in my own family and outside. The assembly of these stores distinctly resembling their own routines.","glossary":[]},"id":"fcba8641-e396-4e1c-9cff-4c576e55f501","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Groups and Memories","text":"Subsequent research pointed me to the book, *The Social Psychology of Experience*, which analyses the work of Maurice Halbwach. Halbwach\u2019s research analyzes how social frameworks support bonds that are rooted around collective memories and ambiguous accounts of past and how memories, in fact, hold groups together rather than the groups determining memories. At the market, with every walk overtaken by my own memories of walking and shopping with the women I knew, the market became symbolic of these collective experiences I shared with them. And watching other women in groups was a reminder of how this old market became a container of many such shared accounts and experiences. The collective experience of walking the market reinforced feelings of belonging and it was this nostalgia and memories that when evoked somehow concealed orthodox patriarchal rigidities that the market (re)produced. This psychology is perhaps also important in understanding how religious rites and social attitudes survive despite the questionable regressive orders they establish.\n\nThe market, by means of certain proximities and convenience, while laying bare gender expectations, orchestrates a performance in their fulfilment. This understanding of gender performativity is informed by the work of Judith Butler who in her essay *Performative Acts and Gender* argues about the theatricality of a gender act. These rehearsed acts, Butler stresses, drawing upon the work of Victor Turner on the rituals of social drama, are a reenactment of pre-established social meanings. Her argument of gender also emphasizes that the acts within these performances are a \u201cshared experience and collective action\u201d. Butler\u2019s assertion on gender as a construction, a repetition and consolidation of a series of acts, points to the market as a space whose ritualized navigation results, over time, in bodies assuming a gender and its narratives. At the market, each act or each visit to a store, in its organization, is thus choreographed and performed to the spectator, to each other, all the while performing to oneself. Halbwach and Butler\u2019s analysis become pertinent in seeing the market as a space where feelings of nostalgia and collective memories become deeply intertwined with the act of gender performance. Here, each subsequent visit to the market therefore becomes a reminder of the last, of collective memories that are rooted in acts and consequently direct one to perform, just as one did in the past.","glossary":[]},"id":"79390001-8aa6-4c8a-872b-9a663f79910e","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Mapping","text":"I start plotting all these stores on a google map. This cartographic exercise confirms that there are about 115 kitchen utensil stores, 196 beauty and wedding stores, 33 grocery stores, 71 plastic goods stores, 77 toy stores, 37 religious supplies store and 63 temples and mosques all within an area of less than a square kilometer. These certainly didn\u2019t account for the makeshift stores all pulled on carts selling heaps of spoons or the smaller trades such fixing, repairing or polishing utensils and jewelry that had sprung on the side. Furthermore, the market laid out gender narratives not just in the proximity of some stores but also in the absence of some kinds such as restaurants, liquor, wine shops or bars. The location of these stores outside the busier market zone and evidently at a greater distance from market center also made explicit that access to them was limited to some genders and undesirable for some others.\n\nThe strange thing about this mapping exercise was that it was as much an exercise in pinning these points on the map and holding on to that information as it meant a snapping of those points and associations that held me to this place. Will I be able to look past these gender narratives that the market prescribed, these new conscious realizations I was having? Where on the map do these new associations live? And those old associations, those collective memories that grounded me, where should they be kept once unpinned? And between the two, where do I stand?","glossary":[]},"id":"f1ca1a8b-ccf2-4284-b44d-6dd362b5f21a","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Taking the Kitchen Out","text":"Kitchen has its own mnemonics, its smells, its sounds, that long serve for its afterthought \u2013 the occasional noise of plates and pots clinking, of spices being ground, of food cooking, all evidence of the kitchen in use, sounds you come to associate with a certain activity, a certain domestic care and comfort that is provided every single day. Over time, this soundscape becomes suggestive of the domestic space itself. \n\nIn what was an unusual expression of appreciation, even for India, the Indian Prime Minister on March 19, 2020, called for the Indian people to bang their pots and pans from their balconies as appreciation for the essential workers in the Covid crisis. What followed this appeal on national television had people assemble in their balconies, on rooftops and drum their pans in gratitude to the front-line workers.\n\nBut the absurdity of this dulls when confronted with the familiarity, the nostalgia and the profound associations of some sounds. It\u2019s as if, deep within, people knew what these sounds symbolized. The national call for this clanging was a call to summon our collective feelings and associations. A call which assumed that all associations which followed some sounds were the same, a collective memory that we all had access to. This brings back Halbwach\u2019s analysis of how collective memories though ambiguous hold groups together, how these private associations, patterns contribute to a public memory. This was a summon for a collective memory, though built privately, that was now a part of what informed a collective identity. This was a call that symbolized kitchen with care and designated that care as essential. And the undertaking of this banging without much hesitance only asserts of a care that was received by many.\n\nAlice Constance Austin\u2019s advocacy for domestic spaces had her pitch for kitchens to be outside living spaces, as community spaces that employed people, both men and women. Her plans for an unrealized co-operative colony in Llano del Rio, California, devised for meals to be served in community halls, in containers that would then be sent to dedicated washing areas and roll away beds on heated tile floors as substitutes for carpets to reduce the housekeeping. All this, she believed, would remove the drudgery of unpaid labor work. \u2028Alice\u2019s work is important in understanding how in re-thinking of gender dynamics and subsequently of social hierarchies, it is imperative that we think of how our social spaces are themselves organized. And perhaps reexamine domestic labor that exists in language, thought and public imagination. And in re-examining and confronting these, Bellacasa\u2019s arguments of ethics and agencies in care, often conflated with human relationships, become pertinent again.","glossary":[]},"id":"35e1810e-27c9-4c65-a25f-6b571feb2826","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Material Studies","text":"Daniel Miller\u2019s *The comfort of things* was crucial in understanding the use of material studies as a method for my research and understanding objects and their relationships to people. It was fundamental also in how studying these possessions and showing a genuine care in understanding their place in people\u2019s lives often reveals the people. Miller\u2019s human portrayal of these households unlike conventional anthropological accounts is embracing of the details that often get lost in academic pursuits of logic and reasoning. However, unlike Miller, who for the large part was successful in keeping his subjective distance while studying these objects and their owners, the research for me was grounding in coming to terms with my subjectivities as a result of my own lived experiences.\n\nAnd coming to terms with these subjective views was a first step towards not dismissing them and eventually valuing them for the perspectives they lent me.\n\nIn her essay *Situated Knowledge*, Donna Haraway argues for this embodied subjective vision or \u201cview from a body\u201d as against a \u201cview from above\u201d which in its disembodied vision and universalism becomes one that she calls as \u201cfantastic, distorted and irrational\u201d. And perhaps, it is in these views from bodies and an acknowledging of what Haraway calls the making of \u201cmeanings and bodies\u201d, also lies the regaining of agency. An agency that comes from valuing the meanings and truths of our subjective embodied visions that have long been discredited due to male-dominant pursuits of a distorted goal. And, for me, this view from my body, in essentially prompting questions, destabilized my perceptions of the market and its place in my life. \n\nI spent the subsequent weeks, in understanding how object-based interviews are conducted. How people\u2019s environment, objects around them and objects they adorn, provide an additional layer of information. Understanding Miller\u2019s portrayal of people in the London street was important in learning to look for information beyond what is questioned and what is answered. As devices to look for information beyond their fixed meanings, patterns or patterning became important. *In Inventive Methods and the Happening of Social*, Janis Jeffries speaks of how by bringing in our embodied experience of the space or the \u2018haptics\u2019, patterning becomes an active way of seeing the world. Jeffries further emphasizes how these subjective undertakings in the seeing and telling of these patterns become active modes of enquiry.\n\nAs the spatial layout of the market became less ambiguous, other details started to stand out. Most stores were either named after men, possibly those who started them. Some had \u2018and sons\u2019 or \u2018and brothers\u2019 as a postfix to the name, while the packaged objects they sold were mostly named after women. Some stores in announcing what they sold, mentioned, \u2018marriage utensils\u2019, likely suggestive of *dowry*. At the market, some popular pressure cookers brands included *Ganga*, brands of wheat flour were called *Annapurna, Aashirwad*, a hoard of beauty products with spiritual significance. Store fronts decked up with posters of women declared possible outcomes of this market trip. Long rows of objects lined up shelves and waited for women with similar names to take them home. Random assemblies no longer random, now spoke of a carefully choreographed language of manipulation.","glossary":[]},"id":"031e4374-c324-47c3-8f61-c80fae3425bd","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Walking","text":"The act of walking has been central to my research. Navigating the market, I was reminded of how innumerable times, the soundscape in evoking a sense of nostalgia, blinded me to gender enactment that the architecture enabled. The soundscape was so overwhelming that you heard it long after you left the market. The experience of walking and what I saw changed with every walk. The first walks were about finding objects to photograph and record. Once the old familiarity settled in, the walks got longer. Soon, the walks almost felt self-biographical. The proximity between the prayer room and the kitchen in my house, and how it worked out well for my grandmother. A proximity that allowed her to move quickly from praying to cooking, devoting herself to the deity and the duty.  The market was very much a public display of a private life. At the market, a day is spent moving from the utensil palaces, the beauty dealers, the incense experts, the toy specialists and bowing to the watchful gods. At home, years are devoted to a dubious beauty, being a devotee and a giving mother, dimming the distinctions of the private from the public. Each mirroring the other, each preparing one for the other, each making the other relevant. \n\nUpon reflection on the research, I\u2019ve come to see the act of walking, photographing and documenting the market was also an act of defiance. A defiance that made the men in the market aware of my gaze. A gaze that I controlled, that I was there to watch them as much as they chose to watch me. Walking with a camera was an act in exercising my agency to look. From a research perspective, it often produced information more visceral than factual, sometimes one that escaped documentation.\n\nOn one such walk in a lane, one minute from the square, when shooting the street, a middle-aged man came shouting after me for photographing his wife. I was clearly caught off guard and surprised. I, then, assured him that I had no such picture and showed him my camera. When I turned around to look for his wife, I saw a woman standing across the street, looking in my direction but clearly out of my view and in full hijab. More than enraging me, the incident was a sad reminder of control, of domination, of power played out in private and if looked carefully enough, in public.","glossary":[]},"id":"93c90c1d-2d73-4101-a2f7-f7ae6dfb9d88","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Interviews","text":"At the market, learning to listen to people\u2019s perspective very different from my own, was also an experience in being human. While people were more than willing to share their thoughts, the camera often became overwhelming. Long hours were spent surveying the market and the fieldwork became heavily reliant on chance encounters. Asking for written permissions made people hesitant and doubtful of the nature of this exercise. As trust built and people got to know me better, they were willing to speak on record. Understanding people\u2019s motivation behind shopping and selling these objects while helping confront my own shifting positions and confusions around them, often revealed the public nature of gender enactments.\n\nOne of my first interviews was with a man who ran a utensil store at the heart of the Bazar, close to the center. The interview which started with him explaining what his customers usually buy had him constantly check if I understood him. His insistence and constant need to check if I understood and agreed with him made me a bit queasy. The more I said \u2018Yes, I understand\u2019, it brought me a little closer to breaking down. At once, his unguarded dominance made him appear larger than his gaunt, aging body. A little into the conversation, he speaks of how he only consumed one meal a day, owing to his age. But he could drink two litres of cow milk, if he wanted. It appeared like a strange show of strength. Those rings on his hands, looked to me, like medals of war. A war which his generation had won, but he was now like a soldier who refused to be forgotten. Could it be that at the age of 67, he didn\u2019t know if I, a representative of those who defect approved of him? Could it be that he was doubtful if I acknowledged the efforts and the collective imagination of his ilk to domesticize my apparitions? Could it be that he just wanted to know if, me and my kin, would continue to plead our allegiance to his sons and after, to their business of constructing my gender and its roles?\n\nThe talk slowly progressed into him explaining the various utensils that are brought by a bride\u2019s family which would then be given away as a part of dowry in the wedding. He continued to explain how he has sometimes seen families, of both bride and groom, disrupt into arguments for *dowry*. Upon asking the relevance and the need for dowry, he explains how these gifts can help brides claim their rightful place in their matrimonial households. At this, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was being considerate or legitimatizing and propagating a practice that has been outlawed. A practice that has been cited as a cause for about forty five percent of all homicides against women in India. Here, Butler\u2019s analysis of gendered acts as \u201cshared experiences and collective action\u201d becomes relevant. The act of gender, as Butler stresses, despite being actively embodied are \u201cnot one\u2019s act alone\u201d and as performed by one are \u201cnot a fully individual matter\u201d. At the market, all actors present, performed. Some took on the role of gate keepers of a culture, some others performed within the laid-out directives. The market also became apparent as a space where abhorrent practices find ground to survive, become cultural conventions that maintain oppressive structures and often make gender crimes conceivable. \n\nAfter my initial days of wandering, I, once, landed in a store that sold glass bangles. Despite my inherent biases about these objects and the attitudes they propagated, I was desperate to hear the accounts of men who sold them. This time, unlike the rest, I was invited to the store. What started as a general talk about the business and the skills involved in the making of these bangles, led the man to pull out his phone and show me what his loyal customers mostly request. He then proceeds to show me bangles for young children. I ask him the age of children who would wear them, and he shows the picture of a young girl, all without any hesitance, and says she is five.\n\nMy calm, at that point, was quickly overtaken by discomfort and anger at a capitalist system which encourages indoctrination young. A system that also desensitizes when profits loom large. The profits, that these stores, which at first seem too small to be making any, are large enough to maintain families, large enough to then \u2018marry-off\u2019 their daughters, and large enough to pass it down the generations.\n\nIt also became evidently clear that the market presented itself as an opportunity to interest and invite women customers who were at the market to shop one thing but inadvertently spent more time visiting other stores. If gender is performed, then the women here performed. Men orchestrated. The competition that came with the presence of other stores, as with most capitalism, only made the businessmen more inventive. Everyone here knew everyone else. Stores directed customers to other stores. Over the years, it became a collective, an organic coming together of stores that helped sustain each other and ultimately the market and unfortunately their idea of womanhood.\n\nOn a subsequent visit to the market, I interviewed a soon to be bride who was shopping at a utensil store with her mother and aunt. The visibly happy bride, when I ask of her trip to the market, illustrates how some utensils, all filled to their brim with grains, will be given away as gifts by her parents. All this, she explains with an affection, were indicative of a girl who was looked after well. When I probe her further of the reasons for these symbolic gestures, she hesitant at first, not finding the right words to explain, finds refuge and a possible certainty in culture as the reason. While patiently elaborating on of some traditions of the wedding rituals which have long been followed, she also describes the convenience of the market and points to the jewelry stores as her next stop. The proximity of the stores, she explains to me, leaves no reason to go elsewhere. A sales representative also speaks of how during some busy wedding months, for the sake of convenience, customers can call, and the store would assemble in advance all the necessary utensils within the agreed budget. As I speak to her, her mother and aunt continue their careful inspection and deliberation of each utensil, and the young male owner interjects the bride\u2019s conversation every now and then and asserts which utensils are critical for the fulfilment of wedding rituals. Meanwhile, a new assortment of utensils was simultaneously being composed by the store\u2019s all-male staff. This narrative was illustrative of what Butler calls as rehearsed gender acts. These acts, Butler argues, are acts that are present before the actors arrive but need a constant reproduction. The bride\u2019s filial devotion to traditions and the men\u2019s expertise of cultural mores all demonstrate Butler\u2019s reasoning of how scripts outlive the actors.\n\nIn a different interview at a kitchen store called *Grahasti*, the owner opens up about how he occasionally filled in for the Imam at the local mosque. The interview, which at first, seemed merely sexist and indicative of a certain influence he commanded, upon consecutive listening and reviewing, gave impressions of fear in the face of India\u2019s current political climate of conservative politics. The interview which begins with him musing over the efforts of his father in starting the store, soon has him earnestly recite the *Azaan* on record.\n\nHis prayer reminded me of times when the worshippers were equal and the worshipped only a few. A time, when to a Hindu, a call to prayer sounded like a hymn and signaled a certain time of the day, like a song you liked but, in a language, you didn\u2019t understand. It was a good feeling. But soon, in what felt unexpected, he explained how he was willing to sacrifice his life for India. It saddened me to now see the Imam who once only bowed to the Allah, suddenly felt subservient to a new master. A master who needed him to prove his allegiance. A master who needed to know that he will do anything for this golden bird that is \u2018India\u2019. And in that moment, I felt connected to him. We were both in our ways responding to a ghoul that had threatened to destroy us in whole.","glossary":[]},"id":"b2d203c0-e5f1-4321-9c82-74892e023392","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"The Position","text":"At the end of each trip to the market, I knew what story I was going to tell. A story of just how things can hide in plain sight, how certain notions of \u2018culture\u2019 were only a conspiracy to advance a patriarchal agenda. I was convinced that I would make a documentary that would have a beginning, a middle and an end. But subsequent discussions with mentors where questions about my position forced me out of an illusion that I could ever tell this story as a means to an end. I spent the next few weeks trying to understand how to write a script where I did not stereotype India for a white audience, where I was kind to the men I interviewed. I was asked if it was my story or that of India? I couldn\u2019t draw precise distinctions. I didn\u2019t know how to define my position around objects that I inherited from my grandmother, objects that would bear her indentations long after she was gone. I spent weeks questioning the point of this work, whether it easy for me to piss over India and its grand \u2018culture\u2019? And who the fuck was I anyway to shame someone or their profession? Was this all just a display of feminist liberation or my newfound intellectual hubris?\n\nIn confronting this, Haraway\u2019s argument of a vision of \u201cpartial perspective\u201d, one she calls \u201csplitting and contradictory\u201d leaps out. A contradictory self, Haraway stresses, is one that is always \u201cforming, interrogating\u201d and \u201cin resisting a finality avoids simplification\u201d. And so, the telling of these stories, I\u2019ve realized, will always be fraught with contradiction. Because, how should I tell the hundred stories I see in each person I\u2019ve interviewed? How should I tell stories of love, hate, anger, absurdity, pain, nostalgia, safety, power and fear all wrapped and neatly catalogued into one? How should I tell a story of my anger without becoming a soldier? And can I tell a story and change it the next day? And since there is no finality, what is this labyrinth I am building?\n\nIn taking this position of ambivalence, Homi Bhabha\u2019s argument of hybridity *in the location of Culture* becomes relevant. Bhabha\u2019s arguments assert ambivalence as a space \u201cwhere the rite of power is enacted on the site of desire, making its objects at once disciplinary and disseminatory\u201d. Bhabha\u2019s explanation become particularly relevant in defining my position around dominance and of not resolving conflicts but instead creating what he calls \u201ca crisis for any concept of authority based on a system of recognition\u201d. Bhabha is referring here to the strategies of ambivalence and hybridity relevant to the colonial identity in its ability to displace authority through discursion, mimicry and changing order. Following Bhabha and in assuming this non-conformity, working across forms, speculating and using the fieldwork in articulation of my contradictory positions, the materials from fieldwork become non-restrictive mediums. Mediums which then provide me the space to position, reposition, ruminate, re-enact, dissect or dismiss them. And in the making of these different statements, instead of crafting a singular position, methods assume performativity and I recognize my agency.","glossary":[]},"id":"fcfd5087-7e50-401c-b4c7-7ed823b2f5ac","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"},{"content":{"title":"Conclusion","text":"The market never withheld what it stood for; I just did not see. But neither did the women in my family. But how long before I stop counting this long line of women who didn\u2019t? And how long will this line be? Will it be long enough to cover the perimeter of the market? And If you looked at these perimeters of women from above, what do they look like? Do they flash bright like the bangles they wear in their hands, or do they look like big hollow zeroes? Zeroes resembling their routines, routines with no beginning or end. Zeroes because their hours in the domestic labor has never been accounted for. Zero is also the shape of my answer to all the questions about the intended audience for my work. So, zero is also an empty space I\u2019ve left for people reading this to fill. Culture is also a zero, a cipher whose language only some qualified to speak and decode, and some others walk around it, alone, in groups, in private and public. How many such zeroes should one circle to become a woman? And, what will it take for these zeroes to break and become question marks?","glossary":[]},"id":"336eca4f-f8a6-4d63-bb7b-2f15309e991c","isHidden":false,"type":"chapter"}]
