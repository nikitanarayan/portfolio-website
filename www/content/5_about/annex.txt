Nikita Narayan <(email: narayan.nikita@gmail.com)>

I am a multidisciplinary designer whose work navigates issues of identity, gender and space. Drawing on methods from ethnography, material culture, sociology and fiction, my work often takes shape as questions and attempts at understanding the socio-spatial and its associated politics. With work bent in research and mediums that result from it, I hope for my work to initiate dialogue and discussion.
