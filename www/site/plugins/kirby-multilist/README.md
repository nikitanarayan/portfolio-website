## 1. Installation

Download and copy this repository to ```/site/plugins/multilist```

Alternatively, you can install it with composer: ```composer require sylvainjule/multilist```

<br/>

## 2. Setup

Use is as you would use [a Structure](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/structure) :

```yaml
multilist:
  label: Multilist example
  type: multilist
  fields:
    name:
      label: Item name
      type: text
    date:
      label: Release date
      type: date
    toggle:
      label: Listed?
      type: toggle
```

<br/>

## 3. Supported fields

The field supports all *inline* field types:

- `text`
- `url`
- `email`
- `select`
- `multiselect`
- `number`
- `tel`
- `tags`
- `range`
- `toggle`
- `time`
- `date`

More complex fields (files, pages, blocks, layout, etc.) **are not supported**.

<br/>

## 4. Field properties

You have access to a lot of the [Structure field properties](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/structure#field-properties), with a few tweaks:

- There is no `columns` property, instead you can directly set a `width: x/x` property on your inner fields.
- There is no `duplicate` property.
